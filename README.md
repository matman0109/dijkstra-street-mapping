# dijkstra-street-mapping
This program takes in a tab-delimited txt file containing intersections with real world coordinates and roads connecting those intersections. User passes names of two intersections via command line terminal and if a path between the two intersections exists, the program uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between them.
